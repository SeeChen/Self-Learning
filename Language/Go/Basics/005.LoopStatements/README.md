## 1. Summary
This chapter introduces **loop statements in Go**, including:
- The single loop keyword: `for`
- Different forms of `for`:
    - Traditional `for init; condition; post {}` (similar to C-style loop)
    - `for condition {}` (similar to `while` loop)
    - `for range` (for iterating over collections)
- Nested loops for complex iterations
- Loop control statements:
    - `break`
    - `continue`
    - `goto`

It demonstrates:
- Looping through slices and maps
- Generating a 9Ã—9 multiplication table
- Using `break` and `continue` to control flow
- Using `goto` for label-based jumps

## 2. Technology
- **Language**: Go 1.24
- **Packages Used**:
    - `fmt`: for formatted printing
- **Features Covered**:
    - `for` loop variations
    - Range-based iteration for slices and maps
    - Nested loops
    - Loop control statements: `break`, `continue`, `goto`

## 3. Key Concepts
- **Basic `for` loop**:
  - Syntax:  
    ```go
    for init; condition; post { ... }
    ```
  - Example:
    ```go
    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        sum += 1
    }
    ```
- **`for` as `while` loop**:
  - Omit initialization and increment:
    ```go
    for sum < 20 {
        sum += 1
    }
    ```
- **`for range` loop**:
  - Iterate over slices:
    ```go
    for i, s := range strings {
        fmt.Printf("%d. %s\n", i, s)
    }
    ```
  - Iterate over maps:
    ```go
    for key, value := range myName {
        fmt.Printf("My %s is %s. ", key, value)
    }
    ```
- **Nested loops**:
  - Used for multi-dimensional iterations (e.g., multiplication table)
- **Loop control statements**:
  - `break`: Exit from a loop or inner loop
  - `continue`: Skip the current iteration and move to the next
  - `goto`: Jump to a labeled statement

## 4. Run & Output
Run the program using:
```bash
go run main.go
```

Expected output:
```bash

## 5. Practice
1. Modify the program to calculate the factorial of numbers using a `for` loop.
2. Write a `for range` loop to sum all elements in an integer slice.
3. Use a nested loop to print a triangle pattern of `*`.
4. Implement a loop that uses `continue` to skip even numbers and print only odd numbers.
5. Experiment with `goto` by creating a loop that jumps to a label when a condition is met.
