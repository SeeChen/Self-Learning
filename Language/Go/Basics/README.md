## 1. Overview
This repository is designed to help me learn the Go programming language step-by-step.  
It includes well-organized examples covering core Go concepts, complete with annotated sample code and practical exercises for hands-on learning.

## 2. Environment Configuration
| Category | Details |
|---:|:---:|
| Platform | Linux Ubuntu / Windows 11 |
| Go Version | `go1.25.3 linux/amd64` / `go1.25.0 windows/amd64` |
| RAM | 16 GB |
| CPU | Intel® Core™ i7-11800H (11th Gen) |

## 3. Content Structure
This repository is structured into step-by-step learning modules:

### 0. Hello
- [000.Hello](./000.Hello/)
> Your first Go program. Verifies that Go is installed and configured correctly.

### 1. Variable Types
- [001.VariableTypes](./001.VariableTypes/)
> Learn the basic built-in data types such as integers, strings, booleans, and floats.

### 2. Variables and Constants
- [002.VariablesAndConstants](./002.VariablesAndConstants/)
> Understand how to declare, initialize, and use variables and constants in Go.

### 3. Operators
- [003.Operators](./003.Operators/)
> Explore arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators.

### 4. Conditional Statements
- [004.ConditionalStatements](./004.ConditionalStatements/)
> Learn control flow with `if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.

### 5. Loop Statements
- [005.LoopStatements](./005.LoopStatements/)
> Understand Go’s looping mechanisms using the `for` loop in different forms.

### 6. Functions
- [006.Functions](./006.Function/)
> Work with function declarations, return values, multiple returns, variadic functions, and scope.

### 7. Arrays
- [007.Arrays](./007.Arrays/)
> Introduction to fixed-length sequences and array indexing.

### 8. Pointers
- [008.Pointers](./008.Pointers/) 
> Learn how Go handles memory references and value manipulation through pointers.

### 9. Struct
- [009.Structs](./009.Structs/)  
> Create custom data types with fields to represent complex objects.

### 10. Slice
- [010.Slices](./010.Slices/)  
> Master Go’s dynamic and powerful slice type including capacity, append, and slicing operations.

### 11. Map
- [011.Maps](./011.Maps/)  
> Associative arrays (key-value storage) and common map operations.

### 12. Type Conversion
- [012.TypeConversion](./012.TypeConversion/)  
> Convert variables between compatible types properly in Go.

### 13. Interfaces
- [013.Interfaces](./013.Interfaces/)  
> Learn Go’s polymorphism and how behavior is defined using interfaces.

### 14. Error Handling
- [014.ErrorHandling](./014.ErrorHandling/)  
> Idiomatic error handling using `error` type and custom error definitions.

### 15. Concurrency
- [015.Concurrency](./015.Concurrency/)  
> Introduction to Go’s powerful concurrency model using goroutines and channels.

### 16. File Handling
- [016.FileHandling](./016.FileHandling/)  
> Read, write, and manipulate files effectively in Go.

### 17. Type Assertion
- [017.TypeAssertion](./017.TypeAssertion/)  
> Learn how to extract concrete types from interfaces safely.

### 18. Inheritance (Embedding)
- [018.Inheritance](./018.Inheritance/)  
> Understand Go’s composition-based inheritance using struct embedding.

## 4. Learning Goals
My goals for learning Go include:
1. Write idiomatic, clean Go code  
2. Understand Go's syntax, type system, and memory model  
3. Build CLI tools and concurrent programs  
4. Prepare for professional, real-world Go development  

## 5. Projects & Practice
You can explore practical projects built with the skills learned in this repository:

### Web Crawler
[View Project](../Projects/WebCrawler/)
> A real-world web scraping project developed with Go.
