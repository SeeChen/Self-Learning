## 1. Summary
Welcome to my Go Programming Language repository!
This project documents my step-by-step progress in mastering Go - from basic syntax to real-world development proctices.

This repository is devided into two main parts:
- **Basics**: Concept-based exercises and foundational examples.
- **Projects**: Practical applications using the knowledge learned.

This structure helps transition from theory to hands-on development effectively.

## 2. Repository Structure
| Directory | Description |
|:---:|:---:|
| [Basics](./Basics/) | All fundamental Go concepts with examples & notes |
| [Projects](./Projects/) | Real-world mini projects built with Go |

> Each subfolder contains its own README for detailed documentation.

## 3. Learning Path
My Go learning roadmap includes:

1. Basics — Syntax, variables, functions, pointers, structs, slices  
2. Core Features — Interfaces, concurrency, error handling  
3. Engineering Skills — File operations & modular design  
4. Real Practice — CLI tools, data processing, web crawler  

Every completed topic is committed and versioned in this repository.

## 4. Environment Setup
| Category | Details |
|:---:|:---:|
| OS | Linux Ubuntu / Windows 11 |
| Go Version | go1.25.x amd64 |
| Tools | VS Code / GoLand / Git |

You can install Go from the official website: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)

To verify installation:
```bash
go version
```

## 5. Project Showcase
Here are some projects I've built while learning Go:
|Project|Status|Description|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|[Web Crawler](./Projects/WebCrawler/)|<ul><li>- [x] Completed</li></ul>|A simple crawler to fetch and store web data|
|Go Language Backend|<ul><li>- [ ] In Progress</li></ul>||
