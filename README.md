## 0. Summary
This repo is my personal self-learning space ‚Äî experiments, notes, chaos, and joy.

`What is the purpose of learning?`
> ### It is for HAPPINESS.

*Learning makes me happy.*  
*Learning makes me happy.*  
*Learning makes me happy.*  

**Important things are said three times!!!**

Sometimes I code. Sometimes I stare at my screen wondering why it‚Äôs not working.  
Still, learning is happiness. üòå

## 1. Happy Learning Route
(Will keep growing as I explore new stuff!)

### 1.0 Nametag
> *AI Object Detection via YOLO*  
Just trying to teach computers to ‚Äúsee things.‚Äù It‚Äôs like magic, but with Python.

- [Nametag](./Nametag/)
- [Document](./Nametag#readme)

### 1.1 REST Using Express JS
> *Building a server with REST API using Express.js and TypeScript.*  
Because who doesn‚Äôt love a good API and endless debugging?

- [REST Using Express JS](./REST_Using_Express_JS/)
- [Document](./REST_Using_Express_JS#readme)

### 1.2 Virtual DOM
> *Front-end virtual DOM implementation.*  
Reinventing the wheel ‚Äî just to understand how it spins.

- [Virtual DOM](./VirtualDOM/)
- [Document](./VirtualDOM#readme)

### 1.3 Programming Language
> *Learn multiple programming languages.*  
Each new language = one new way to feel confused and amazed.

- [Language](./Language/)
- [Document](./Language#readme)

## 2. File ".gitignore"
All the `.gitignore` files are merged here (sorted by project name).  
Each section starts with a centered `###` title, followed by the file contents.  
Simple and neat.

###### *You don‚Äôt know what EOF is? Go learn C!  
C Language ‚ù§Ô∏è YOU, but you still ghosted it.*
