## 1. Summary
This task involved identifying and tracking a staff member wearing a nametag using [video](sample.mp4) footage from a 3D sensor. The goal was to determine which frames contained the staff member and locate their coordinates when present. I selected the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for this task because of its fast object detection capabilities.
